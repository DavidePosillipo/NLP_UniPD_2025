Any N-gram is just a sequence of \"n\" words. For example, \"Saurav\" is a unigram and \"Hi There\" is a bigram. \n\n\nThe task is to find out if we can compute $P(w | h)$ given a word $w$ and some history $h$. One could say that we can compute the probability of a given next word, using all the previous words in the sentence. For example using the last sentence, we could calculate: \n\n$$\\large\nP ( \\, word \\, | \\, One \\, could \\, say \\, that \\, we \\, can \\, compute \\, the \\, probability \\, of \\, a \\, given \\, next \\,)\n$$\n\n---\n\nOne such approach could be to use **relative frequency counts** to compute this probability, i.e. ,**Out of the times we saw the history $h$, how many times was it followed by the word $w$**\n\nOr \n\n$$\nP ( \\, word \\, | \\, One \\, could \\, say \\, that \\, we \\, can \\, compute \\, the \\, probability \\, of \\, a \\, given \\, next \\,) = \\frac{C(\\, One \\, could \\, say \\, that \\, we \\, can \\, compute \\, the \\, probability \\, of \\, a \\, given \\, next \\, word)}{C(\\, One \\, could \\, say \\, that \\, we \\, can \\, compute \\, the \\, probability \\, of \\, a \\, given \\, next \\,)}\n$$\n---\n\nIntuitively it seems infeasible to perform this over an entire corpus; especially it is of a significant a size. This is the motivation behind the N-gram model, instead of using the entire corpus, we approximate this probability using just `n` previous words.\n\nFor instance if $w_{1:n}$ represents the sequence of words $w_1w_2...w_n$, then using the chain rule of probability we can write,  \n\n\n$$\\large\nP(w_{1:n}) = P(w_1)P(w_2 | w_1)P(w_3 | w_{1:2})...P(w_n|w_{1:n-1})\n$$\n\n\n$$\\large\nP(w_{1:n}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{n}P(w_k | w_{1:k-1})\n$$\n\n<a id=\"bigram-model\"></a>\n## The Bigram Model ②\n\nA Bigram Model corresponds to a model which approximates the probability of a word given all the previous words $P(w_n|w_{1:n−1})$ by using only the conditional probability of the preceding word $P(w_n|w_{n−1})$. Thus we assume that $P(w_n|w_{1:n−1}) ≈ P(w_n|w_{n−1})$. This approximation is known as the **Markov** approximation. Thus, for the Bigram model, the probability for an entire sequence can be approximated as:\n\n$$\\large\nP(w_{1:n}) ≈ \\prod_{k=1}^{n}P(w_{k}|w_{k−1}) \n$$\n\n<a id=\"estimation\"></a>\n## Estimation ⩰\n\nTo estimate such probabilities we use the **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**. An MLE estimate for the parameters of an n-gram model can be obtained by getting counts from a corpus, and normalizing the counts so that they lie between 0 and 1.\n\nFor a Bigram model, the MLE Estimation can be given by:\n\n$$\\large\nP(w_n | w_{n-1}) \\frac{C(w_{n-1}w_n)}{\\sum_{w} C(w_{n-1}w)}\n$$\n\n---\nFor the general case of MLE n-gram parameter estimation:\n\n$$\\large\nP(w_n|w_{n−N+1:n−1}) = \\frac{C(w_{n−N+1:n−1}w_n)}{C(w_{n−N+1:n−1})}\n$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"basic-setup\"></a>\n# 📂 Basic Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this **hidden** code cell, we'll import our packages.
